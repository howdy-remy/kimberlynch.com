  bio: `I’m Kimber Lynch, a designer and developer located somewhere in the Northeast US (I’m not always certain where). I love a good problem and work to find the optimal solution from creating the best design to make an impact to solving that funky little bug in the code that I can’t seem to quit thinking about. I am constantly exploring and picking up new skills which in the past have included silk screening, letterpress, book-binding, indoor rock climbing, and even hula-hooping. I’m currently working to gain a deeper understanding of web development and catch up on current trends and best practices. I’ve also recently completed a 3 month, 13,000-mile trip around the US with my fiancé in a Ford E350 van we converted over the summer.

On a more formal note, I graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 2011 with departmental honors and was excited to be selected to show my work at the Art Director’s Club New York Student Portfolio Review. While working at Visual Dialogue I have had the opportunity to work on several excellent and rewarding projects including the Grammy winning design for Woody at 100: The Centennial Collection.

Projects I have worked on have been recognized by Communication Arts, Creative Review, Dexigner, FPO, Hatch, Packaging of the World, Art of the Menu.`,
