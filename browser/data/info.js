  bio: `I’m Kimber Lynch, a fullstack developer and designer—and currently open to opportunities!

I have a compulsive curiosity to always learn more which perhaps was born from reading *Collier’s Encyclopedia* for fun as a child—oh, yes, I was *that* kid. That curiosity drove me to purchase a 1999 Ford E350 (lovingly named “Vincent Van Go”), repair the mechanical components, gut the interior and build out a living space complete with a solar electrical system, and then take it out on a three-month, 13,000 mile trip to over 34 states and several National Parks & Monuments. I still can’t read a map, however I have picked up a handful of semi-useful skills including silk screening, letterpress, book-binding, indoor rock climbing, and even hula-hooping. 

When I was done with that journey I immediately started my next one at [Grace Hopper Academy](http://gracehopper.com), an immersive coding bootcamp for women and the sister school to Fullstack Academy. I was surrounded by excited, passionate women all working together to learn fullstack development. After graduating I was hired on as a teaching fellow and had the amazing opportunity to mentor the next group of women while also working as an engineer on the proprietary learning software used in the curriculum. 

Back before I dedicated my time to coding, I graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design with departmental honors and was excited to be selected to show my work at the Art Director’s Club New York Student Portfolio Review. While working at [Visual Dialogue](http://visualdialogue.com), a creative agency in Boston, I worked on several excellent and rewarding projects including the Grammy winning design for *Woody at 100: The Centennial Collection*.`,
