  bio: `I'm Kimber Lynch, a fullstack developer and designer—and currently open to opportunities!

I have a compulsive curiosity to always learn more which perhaps was born from reading *Collier’s Encyclopedia* for fun as a child—oh, yes, I was *that* kid. However, I have picked up a handful of semi-useful skills including silk screening, letterpress, book-binding, indoor rock climbing, solar/electrical systems, and even hula-hooping. 

That curiosity drove me to purchase a 1999 Ford E350 (lovingly named “Vincent Van Go”), repair the mechanical components, and gut the interior behind the cockpit to build out a custom living space complete with a bed, cabinets, and additional storage, plus solar electricity which powered lighting, a ventilation fan, and an outlet for auxiliary power for charging laptops on the road. I then took three months to drive 13,000 miles around the US visiting cities and National Parks & Monuments across 31 states. I still can’t read a map.

And when I was done with that journey I attended [Grace Hopper Academy](http://gracehopper.com), an immersive coding bootcamp for women, the sister school to Fullstack Academy. I was surrounded by excited, passionate women all working together to learn fullstack development. After graduating I was hired on as a teaching fellow and had the amazing opportunity to mentor the next group of women while also getting the chance to engineer on the proprietary learning software used in the curriculum.

On a more formal note, I graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 2011 with departmental honors and was excited to be selected to show my work at the Art Director’s Club New York Student Portfolio Review. While working at [Visual Dialogue](http://visualdialogue.com) I had the opportunity to work on several excellent and rewarding projects including the Grammy winning design for *Woody at 100: The Centennial Collection*.`,
